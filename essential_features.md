## Best Practices

### Core Principles
1. **Idempotency**: Running the same migration multiple times should not create duplicate data
2. **Atomicity**: Ensure transactions are properly handled
3. **Resilience**: Ability to handle network issues and other failures gracefully
4. **Scalability**: Handle large datasets efficiently
5. **Configurability**: Allow users to customize the migration process
6. **Testability**: Include ways to verify the migration results

### Implementation Priorities
The most critical features to implement include:
- Reliable data transfer
- Accurate schema mapping
- Good performance for large datasets
- Robust error handling
- Clear logging and monitoring
- Secure credential management
